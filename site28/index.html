  <h1>The History of This Website</h1>
  <p>At first, there was nothing. Just an empty void of digital silence.</p>
  <p>Then, the <span class="tag">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration appeared — a proclamation that this page shall follow the rules of HTML5.</p>
  <p>Shortly after, the <span class="tag">&lt;html&gt;</span> tag emerged, marking the birth of the document's structure. It proudly declared its language: English.</p>
  <p>Inside, the <span class="tag">&lt;head&gt;</span> was formed — the brain of the page. It gained a <span class="tag">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</span> to speak many characters, and a <span class="tag">&lt;title&gt;</span> to name itself.</p>
  <p>A <span class="tag">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag joined in, bringing color, typography, and layout — giving life to form.</p>
  <p>Then came the <span class="tag">&lt;body&gt;</span>, the heart of the page. It received a <span class="tag">&lt;h1&gt;</span> — its proud headline. Paragraphs followed, one by one, telling this very story.</p>
  <p>And thus, a simple page was born. Not much — just some structured light and digital ink — but with a soul of its own.</p>
